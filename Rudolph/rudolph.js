    about: ["In 1960, Wilma Rudolph became the first American woman to win three gold medals in track and field at a single Olympics. This is even more impressive if you consider she suffered from several early childhood illnesses, including pneumonia and scarlet fever, and contracted infantile paralysis (caused by the polio virus) at the age of four. She recovered from polio, but lost strength in her left leg and foot. Physically disabled for much of her early life, Rudolph wore a leg brace until she was eight years old.", "Eight years later, at the age of sixteen, she attended the 1956 Olympics and won her first Olympic medal. She went on to compete in the 1959 Pan America games and the 1960 Olympics where she became the first American woman to win three gold medals in a single Olympiad.", "Rudolph is remembered as one of the fastest women in track and as a source of great inspiration for generations of athletes. She once stated, 'Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday.' In 2004, the United States Postal Service honored the Olympic champion by featuring her likeness on a 23-cent stamp. Wilma Rudolph died from complications of brain and throat cancer in 1994."
