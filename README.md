# Herstorical-Women

## Motivation
I created this project to help me understand CSS and HTML layouts better and the process of building a multi-page site efficiently. Building bigger project requires a lot of for-thought and planning and I want to experience that process so I could learn from it. I plan to build more pages using object oriented programming with JavaScript and jQuery, a database and JSON. This project is going to be going on for years.
