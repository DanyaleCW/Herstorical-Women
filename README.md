# Herstorical-Women

## Motivation
I created this project to help me understand CSS and HTML layouts better and the process of building a multi-page site efficiently. Building bigger project requires a lot of for-thought and planning and I want to experience that process so I could learn from it. I plan to build more pages using object oriented programming with JavaScript and jQuery, a database and JSON. This project is going to be going on for years.

### What I have learned 7-2019
I have been working on this site for a year and below is what I have learned.
  1. I did not do enough wire framing.
  2. I did not think enough about user flow.
  3. I need think more about how files are set up. I have too many files. üòû
  4. I need to use JS more and understand it better.
  5. Algorithms, I need them and I am not comfortable with them so I avoid them. I need to learn to like them and use them.
  6. I need a design system.
  7. How one small change one place, effects so many other things. Changes require a lot of thought and planning.
  8. Debugging - I am much better at it.
I learned a lot, I am looking forward to learning more, and I cannot wait to see how much better this site is in July 2020!!!
